## Search-Engine

#### *This project implements a book search engine based on Elasticsearch (the more relative the book is with the given search input, the higher is ranked using TF-IDF metrics etc.) and re-ranks the retrieved results (user personalization) using machine learning techniques. The algorithm also tries to find correlations on how users rate, depending on their demographics using clustering techniques.*
