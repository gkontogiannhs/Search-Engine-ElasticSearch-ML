# Search-Engine

## This project implements a book search engine based on Elasticsearch which decides the order of the results(the more relative the book is with the given search input, the higher is ranked) using machine learning techniques. The algorithm also tries to find correlations on how users rate, depending on their demographics using clustering techniques.
